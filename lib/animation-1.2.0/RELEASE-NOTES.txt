                             Version 1.2
                            Release Notes
                        

INTRODUCTION

    This release fixes two bugs, ships with an overhauled tutorial,
    and comes in a new distribution format.


BUGS FIXED

    o Incorrect sector computation in linear interpolations.
    o Animator startTime is set too early, so that animations
      with a short duration may never get started and stopped.
    
    
CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE COMPATIBILITY

    O AnimatedLabel#animationEnabled -> AnimatedLabel#animated
    
    
DISTRIBUTION CHANGES

    The sources now ship in the directory structure used by the CVS. 
    This makes it easier to build the distribution using ANT.     
    If you want to attach the library sources in an IDE, 
    point to folder 'src/core'.
    
    
OTHER CHANGES:

    o Corrected implementation title and vendor in the JAR manifest.
    o Fixed broken package information in the JAR manifest.
    o Added project name tag to the ANT build file.
    o Set 'build.compile.source' and 'build.compile.target' to '1.4'
      in the default.properties; build.xml honors the source setting.
    o Tutorial cleanup.
